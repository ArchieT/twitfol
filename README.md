# `twitfol.go` and `folgat.sh`

`twitfol.go` is a small program for getting you the list of your followers on stdout.

It prints the list in format `<screenname><tab><userid>`.
This behavior can be changed in the code, there are many other properties that can be chosen.

It prints the list of the followers of the user of the consumer key.
This behavior can be changed in the code. But I'm pretty sure you need to provide *some* consumer key.
